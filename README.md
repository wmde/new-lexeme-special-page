## Deploy Local Commits

### The first time you run a deploy

To be able to run the netlify commands locally you will need to run `npx netlify login` once after `npm install` to authenticate and obtain a token.

### Every time when doing a deploy

To create a deploy of the current commit, run `npm run deployCommit`. This will create a build in the `./dist` folder and create a manual deployment to a unique address that will be generated at the time of deploy.
